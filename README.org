* clojure2minizinc

  A Clojure library designed to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). It generates [[www.minizinc.org][MiniZinc]] code from a CSP specified in Clojure, that is very similar to the corresponding MiniZinc code. The generated MiniZinc program is then solved by one of the MiniZinc solvers (e.g., see http://www.minizinc.org/software.html) available, and the result is read back into Clojure.


** TODO Installation 

   - Installation of MiniZinc tools
     - [General distribution] (includes translation of MiniZinc to intermediate simpler format FlatZinc, which is understood by many solvers)
     - Additional solvers (optional)

   - Installation of this library (with =lein=)

** TODO Usage 

*** TODO A Minimal Example 

    TODO: Revise: update if necessary (e.g., =clj2mnz= will likely be gone, and explicit variable MiniZinc names will be optional. 

#+begin_src clojure :results silent
(minizinc 
   (clj2mnz
    (let [a (variable (domain 0 3) 'a) ;; mzn var naming redundant, but ensures var name in *.mzn file
          b (variable (domain 0 3) 'b)]
      (constraint (!= a b))
      (solve :satisfy)
      (output-map {:a a :b b}))))
#+end_src

Returns:    

Generates in the background this MiniZinc code and calls solver with it


*** Further Reading 

    The [[http://www.minizinc.org/downloads/doc-latest/minizinc-tute.pdf][MiniZinc tutorial]] is also a useful documentation for this library. 


** Design 

   Most Clojure functions simply generate a string with the corresponding MiniZinc code. So, this library is very easy to extend to support not only the full feature set of MiniZinc, but also MiniZinc extensions proposed by various research projects.

   The downside is that debugging the Clojure programs is somewhat difficult. For example, error messages by MiniZinc refer to line numbers of the generated MiniZinc code. However, constraint problem debuggers are not too helpful anyway. A useful technique is usually to disable all constraints for testing and then by and by enabling them again.
